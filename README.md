# HackerChain - Hacker Authentication Service built for the Universal Profile 

## Focus:
HackerChain is a service that allows developers to authenticate themselves on a variety of web2 platforms, which can be used to showcase on a special keychain within their Lukso Universal Profile.

## Background:
Social media forums such as Discord have become a popular place for developers in the web3 space to network and find jobs. The informal nature of this type of job market has lead to a situation where it can become difficult to verify who someone is, when all you know about them is the really long skill-set they copy and pasted to a discussion board. 

HackerChain attempts to solve this by being a quick way for someone, such as a person looking for a developer, to verify that someone on discussion board is who they claim to be. It is defined as a a special key-value pair schema that lives within a persons Universal Profile. Since the keys to a profile are public, any 3rd party can then observe this key value pair to check if a hacker has verified themselves with a particular service, wether itâ€™s GitHub or Twitter.
